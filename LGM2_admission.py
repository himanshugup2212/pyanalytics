#Topic:Logistic Regression
#-----------------------------
#libraries

#In general, a binary logistic regression describes the relationship between the dependent binary variable and one or more independent variable/s.

#The binary dependent variable has two possible outcomes:
#‘1’ for true/success; or
#‘0’ for false/failure

#case : let’s say that your goal is to build a logistic regression model in Python in order to determine whether candidates would get admitted to a prestigious university.
#there are two possible outcomes: Admitted (represented by the value of ‘1’) vs. Rejected (represented by the value of ‘0’).

#split data : Then, apply train_test_split. For example, you can set the test size to 0.25, and therefore the model testing will be based on 25% of the dataset, while the model training will be based on 75% of the dataset:

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.25,random_state=0)

print (y_pred) #predicted values
#The prediction was also made for those 10 records (where 1 = admitted, while 0 = rejected):

#%%predict on new data set
#use the existing logistic regression model to predict whether the new candidates will get admitted. The new set of data can then be captured in a second DataFrame called df2:
