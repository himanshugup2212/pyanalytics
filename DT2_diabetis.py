#%%%% : Load Data
col_names = ['pregnant', 'glucose', 'bp', 'skin', 'insulin', 'bmi', 'pedigree', 'age', 'label']

#This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
#https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
#he datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
# load dataset

.7 * 768  #70% of 768 go into train set rest to test

#%%% : Feature Selection
#need to divide given columns into two types of variables dependent(or target variable) and independent variable(or feature variables).

#split dataset in features and target variable
feature_cols = ['pregnant', 'insulin', 'bmi', 'age', 'glucose', 'bp', 'pedigree']
X = pima[feature_cols] # Features - bmi, age etc
y = pima.label # Target variable : has diabetes =1
#predict y on X
#%%% Splitting Data
#To understand model performance, dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set is a good strategy.
#Let's split the dataset by using function train_test_split(). You need to pass 3 parameters features, target, and test_set size.
# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1) 
# 70% training and 30% test : each for train and test (X & y)

#classification rate of 67.53%, considered as good accuracy. You can improve this accuracy by tuning the parameters in the Decision Tree Algorithm.

#%%% : Features
#Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize.
#It can easily capture Non-linear patterns.
#It requires fewer data preprocessing from the user, for example, there is no need to normalize columns.
#It can be used for feature engineering such as predicting missing values, suitable for variable selection.
#The decision tree has no assumptions about distribution because of the non-parametric nature of the algorithm
#%%% : Cons
#Sensitive to noisy data. It can overfit noisy data.
#The small variation(or variance) in data can result in the different decision tree. This can be reduced by bagging and boosting algorithms.
#Decision trees are biased with imbalance dataset, so it is recommended that balance out the dataset before creating the decision tree.


#%%% : Visualizing Decision Trees
#You can use Scikit-learn's export_graphviz function for display the tree within a Jupyter notebook. For plotting tree, you also need to install graphviz and pydotplus.
#pip install graphviz
#pip install pydotplus
#export_graphviz function converts decision tree classifier into dot file and pydotplus convert this dot file to png or displayable form

#Optimizing Decision Tree Performance
#criterion : optional (default=”gini”) or Choose attribute selection measure: This parameter allows us to use the different-different attribute selection measure. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini index and “entropy” for the information gain.

#splitter : string, optional (default=”best”) or Split Strategy: This parameter allows us to choose the split strategy. Supported strategies are “best” to choose the best split and “random” to choose the best random split.

#max_depth : int or None, optional (default=None) or Maximum Depth of a Tree: The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all the leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples. The higher value of maximum depth causes overfitting, and a lower value causes underfitting (Source).
